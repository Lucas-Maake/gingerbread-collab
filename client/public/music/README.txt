BACKGROUND MUSIC INSTRUCTIONS
=============================

To add background music to the Gingerbread Collab Builder:

1. Find a royalty-free lofi Christmas instrumental track
   Recommended sources:
   - https://pixabay.com/music/ (search "christmas lofi")
   - https://www.bensound.com/
   - https://freemusicarchive.org/

2. Download an MP3 file and rename it to: background.mp3

3. Place the file in this folder:
   client/public/music/background.mp3

4. Refresh the app - music will start playing automatically
   (after first user interaction due to browser autoplay policies)

REQUIREMENTS:
- Format: MP3 (recommended) or OGG
- Duration: 2-5 minutes (will loop seamlessly)

The music plays at 30% volume by default. Users can mute/unmute
